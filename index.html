<h4>Cities I've lived in</h4>
<p>I knew that I didn't want to live my entire life in one place. I figured that going away for college would be the surest way to leave Denver and quickly set down roots in another city. Boston is also incredibly beautiful and a great walking city that is really easy to get around and feels small despite it's population size. </p>

<h4>Top 3 Cities I'd Like to Visit</h4>
<p>I have heard incredible things about the cities below. One of my good friends has been fortunate to travel to many cities all over the world and he has highly recommended Brazil and Thailand. The reason that I would like to go to Santa Cruz in the Galapagos is because I know a really amazing local family here in Denver who is from there and talks about the beautiful landscape and the abundance of wildlife that can be found there.</p>
